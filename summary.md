You’ve come a long way. You started the project by:

Hard coding business information
Simulating a list of businesses
Simulating a query to the Yelp API
Now, your project is at a state where all of these initial issues have been solved. You can now search the Yelp API for restaurants that match a search option!

Over the course this project, you utilized the React library, importing and exporting components, the Yelp API, props, and more to achieve a fully functioning Yelp-like clone.

You should be proud of how far you’ve come. As you continue towards your goal of building front-end web apps, you’ll continue to use many of these foundational skills as you learn more challenging and advanced concepts.

We suggest that you push your React knowledge by adding features to Ravenous. This will allow you to not only reinforce your new skills, but create something unique and exciting in the process. We’ve provided a few ideas for how to improve Ravenous in the hint below, but now that you know how to code, you can implement any feature you want!

Once again, congratulations on a successful project and thank you for all of the hard work you put into this project. Enjoy!
